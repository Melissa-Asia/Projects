              The objective of Clam Blitz is to pick up clams, which are
              scattered around the stage, and deposit them into the goal near
              the opposing team's base. Once a player picks up ten/eight clams,
              it transforms into a Power Clam, which is used to destroy the
              barrier around the other team's goal when thrown towards it.
              Breaking the opponent's barrier with a Power Clam awards twenty
              points and lifts the team's barrier, preventing the enemy team to
              score points.

              Rainmaker is similar to Tower Control in that it requires teams to
              move a certain object to a point in the other team's base.
              However, in Rainmaker, only one player may have control of the
              Rainmaker and they control where it goes. The device is encased in
              a shield similar to a Zapfish's bubble and must be freed before it
              can be picked up. If one team bursts the Rainmaker shield, all
              players of the other team caught in the blast radius are instantly
              splatted. The Rainmaker can then be picked up by either team.
              Touching an intact shield causes a small amount of damage.

              Splat Zones plays similarly to the King of the Hill mode in other
              video games. It revolves around a number of "zones", usually one
              single zone in the center of a map, which players must attempt to
              cover in their team's ink. Once a team has covered 70% of a zone
              in their ink, the zone is "captured" by the team. When all of the
              zones have been captured by a team, that team is "in control" of
              the zones and their respective "countdown clock" (or simply,
              "clock" or "timer") begins to count down from 100. The opposing
              team must try to capture the zones in the same manner.

              In Tower Control, two teams of four players fight to control a
              central tower that moves through the stage along a predetermined
              path. The path is mirrored and goes towards each side of the
              team's territory. The tower starts at the center, and when a
              player rides on top of it, it begins moving towards the enemy
              territory. If an enemy player is standing on the tower while the
              player rides it, the tower is contested and it stops moving. If
              the player standing on the tower falls off the platform or gets
              splatted, after an enemy player stands on the tower or five
              seconds have passed, the tower begins moving rapidly back to its
              initial position.
